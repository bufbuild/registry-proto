  //
  //   - It comes from a dependency of the Module specified via the ResourceRef used in the request.
  //     For example, if the ResourceRef specifies "buf.build/foo/bar", which depends on
  //     "buf.build/foo/baz", all files from "buf.build/foo/baz" will be imports.
  //   - It is a Well-Known Type, and the Well-Known Type was not part of the Module specified
  //     via the ResourceRef used in the request. Well-Known Types are special in the Protobuf ecosystem,
  //     and can be imported without being contained in a specified module.
  //   - It contains symbols that are referenced by symbols specified in the request. For example,
  //     if the request specified symbol "foo.v1.Foo" contained within "foo.proto", which has a message
  //     field of type "baz.v1.Baz", which is contained within "baz.proto", then the file "baz.proto"
  //     will be marked as an import, regardless of which Module it derived from. If the symbols field
  //     is not specified on the request, this situation will never occur.

  // the syntax was explicitly specified or not. This prevents programs (such as linters) from

  // As opposed to syntax on a FileDescriptorProto, this field will be empty if no syntax was
